Adds Helmets with Create Mod Goggle Function and Vanilla Armorstats

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### For Players

Download the latest JAR file from GitHub releases or from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/create-plus) and drop it into your `mods` folder.

### For Modcreators (available from 0.5.1 and upwards)

(You need to install CreatePlus to use the features of course)

#### Viewing goggle information for your custom helmets
You can use tags for your helmets to display the goggleinformation (in your resources folder create the file `goggle.json` at `resources/data/createplus/tags/items`)
Here is an example:

```
{
  "replace": false,
  "values": [
    "yourmodid:your_helmet_id"
  ]
}
```

#### Custom goggle helmet recipe

If you have a normal modded helmet e.g. copper and want to have a goggle helmet of it too

Option 1:
```
File: your_helmet_id.json (at `resources/data/yourmodid/recipes`):

{
	"type":"createplus:helmet_crafting",
	"pattern":
	[
		"HG"
	],
	"key":
	{
		"H": {"item": "yourmodid:your_plain_helmet_id"},
		"G": {"item": "create:goggles"}
	},
	"result":{"item":"yourmodid:your_goggle_helmet_id"}
}
```
Option 2:

use the CreatePlusRecipeBuilder in combination with a RecipeDataProvider
